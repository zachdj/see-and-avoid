### What is this repository for? ###

This project seeks to develop a robust "See and Avoid" system for autonomous UAVs.  OpenGL is used to render a sample cockpit video.  The OpenGL rendering is fed into a vision processing algorithm that uses the OpenCV library.  Aircraft and other obstacles are identified and tracked using the vision processing algorithm.  When an obstacle is determined to be a collision threat, an avoidance maneuver will be attempted.  

The project has been supported by the NSF REU site at Auburn University.

### How do I get set up? ###
